# Real-Time USB Directory Sync üîÑüíæ

**Python script** that provides **real-time synchronization** of a local folder (`SOURCE`) to a USB folder (`DESTINATION`). It's designed to keep your backup or working copy instantly updated on portable storage by detecting file **creation, modification, and deletion**, while intelligently handling USB **unplug/replug events** for continuous operation.

**!!This script will not sync these files.!!**
## Files starting with . (dot files)
-Examples: .git, .gitignore, .env, .vscode, .idea, .DS_Store

## Files ending with ~ (backup files)
-Examples: file.txt~, backup~

## Files with extensions: .tmp, .swp, .swx
-These are temporary files from editors

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-Time Sync:** Uses an event-driven mechanism (no polling) for instant sync on file changes.
* **Initial Full Sync:** Guarantees consistency between source and destination when the script first starts.
* **Intelligent USB Handling:** Syncing **automatically pauses** if the USB drive is removed and **resumes** when it's reconnected.
* **Full Change Support:** Correctly manages file **creation, modification, and deletion**.
* **Logging:** Logs all changes and events with timestamps.
* **Debouncing:** Prevents duplicate syncs during rapid file changes.
* **Graceful Stop:** Script stops safely when you type **`q`** or **`quit`** in the console.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

* **Python 3.8+** (Installed on Windows).
* The **`watchdog`** Python library for folder monitoring.

## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Install Python

1.  Download the installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **Crucially**, ensure you check **"Add Python to PATH"** during the installation process.

### 2. Install `watchdog` Library

Open your Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:

```bash
pip install watchdog
```

### 3. Download the Script
Save your Python script (e.g., sync.py) to a permanent location on your PC.

## üíª Usage
### 1. Configure Paths (üö® Important)
You must edit the sync.py file to set your source and destination directories. Change the example paths below to match your actual folders:

Python
SOURCE = r"Change this to your local folder"

DESTINATION = r"Change this to your USB folder"

### 2. Run Manually
Run the script from your console:

```bash
python sync.py
```

Script Behavior:
Performs an initial full sync.
Watches the source folder for changes and syncs them to the USB in real-time.
Pauses if the USB is removed and resumes upon reconnection.
To stop: Type q or quit in the console window.

### 3. Run Automatically in VS Code (Optional)
You can configure VS Code to start the sync script every time you open the workspace.
In VS Code, go to Terminal ‚Üí Configure Tasks ‚Üí Create tasks.json file from template ‚Üí Others.
Replace the content with the configuration below:

```JSON
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Run USB Sync",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["Your path to Sync.py"],
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            },
            "presentation": {
                "echo": true,
                "reveal": "always",
                "focus": true,
                "panel": "shared"
            },
            "problemMatcher": []
        }
    ]
}
```
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: You must update the path in the args ["Your Path to Sync.py"] to the exact location of your sync.py file. to make this work automatically
Now, every time you open this VS Code workspace, the sync script will start automatically in a shared terminal panel.
